                    In order to take you down the weaving road that is my life and professional career, I must first provide some background. Born in a tiny hospital room in New Jersey, the wide-eyed infant of an immigrant family...Oops, too far back. In 2013, I graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park with a degree in Economics. There I earned an Honors Citation. After leaving college, I embarked on a quest of self-realization. My first job after leaving college was as a Software tester for Orchestro. Despite the fancy title, this job pretty much entailed fabricating data in Excel for the purpose of testing the companies primary software, a supply-chain management tool. After leaving this position, I got a job at the Indian Angel Network. While you may be thrown by the name, this job did not involve connecting with the Messengers of God. The Indian Angel Network, or IAN for short, is India's first and largest Angel Investment firm, specializing in the funding of early stage start-ups. IAN has invested in over 130 startups across multiple countries. IAN's network is made up of investors from 11 countries. My job was to help set up the UK chapter, IAN's first chapter outside of India. My primary duties were to build visibility, act as the first point of contact for entrepreneurs, vet investment documents, connect entrepreneurs to investors, and finally to organize events such as pitch sessions. From there my path diverged from Angel Investment. I went on to study Jewelry Design, Environmental Science and Technology, and even work as an Urban Farmer in Washington, D.C. However all these career paths left me with a sense of longing. I was searching for a way to unite my interests in cutting edge technology, social good, as well as creative expression. I finally landed on being a Mobile/Web App Developer. For this reason in 2018 after taking a few online courses, I decided to enroll in GW's Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp intensive. If you click the Portfolio link at the top of the page, you will be able to see my progress as a Developer.
